    <h4>Arguing for Semantic</h4><br />
    <p>Semantic versioning is useful in the way it conveys messages to developers and users of a software package or API
        by having pre-defined meanings behind the version numbers and the number positions. I have some software I need
        to interact with that does <b>not</b> use semantic versioning and I have to go through a whole battery of tests
        and
        compatibility checks each time it is updated. If they used semantic versioning I would know when I can get by
        with fewer tests (minor versions shouldn't break backward compatibility), and when I need to do more (major
        versions break compatibility). If they signaled in their versioning (or at all) when an update is potentially
        backward compatibility breaking it would influence how I approach my own testing and certification of the
        software.</p>
    <p>Bootstrap appears to use semantic versioning. They are currently on version 4.2.1. It's the 4th major release of
        Bootstrap, it is not fully backward compatible with the 3rd release, there have been two feature updates, and
        one patch since the last feature update.</p>
