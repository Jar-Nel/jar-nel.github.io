            <p class="mb-0">"<i>Publishing source code is not the same as developing in the open; there are corporate
                    open-source projects where all development is done privately, in-house, with few-to-no outside contributions
                    accepted. The code is published periodically (often without the full commit history, so providing no way to
                    see
                    how the code was incrementally developed) with an open-source license attached. For the most part, Microsoft
                    hasn't used this model; instead, it uses the GitHub for authoritative repositories, with all development
                    published to GitHub as it's done. Microsoft welcomes outside contributions, uses GitHub's issue tracking to
                    publicly record bugs and feature requests, and the projects engage with their user and developer communities
                    to
                    prioritize new development. <strong>This is a corporation doing open source the right way.</strong></i>"</p>
