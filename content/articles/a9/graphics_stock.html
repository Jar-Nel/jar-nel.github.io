    <h4>Stocking Stuffer</h4>
    <p>Pictures bring visual interest to a website. You <em>want</em> images on your site to grab the attention of the
        reader but images and photographs are protected by copyright. You shouldn't use pictures you don't have
        permission or a license to use. </p>
    <p>So what are the options? You can either use your own images (as I have done on this article), you can get
        permission from the creator of an image, or you can make use of <em>stock photography</em>.</p>
    <p>Stock photography consists of professional photographs that are bought and sold on a royalty-free basis and can
        be used (and reused) for commercial purposes. Often, a license is purchased from the artist or publisher to use
        their work. Fortunatly there are a number of places where stock photography can be found and licensed for
        <em>free</em>.</p>
    <h4>Sites for free stock photography:</h4>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5><span class="text-info">Pexels</span></h5>
            <p>Pexels bills itself as "the best free stock photos shared by talented photographers" and they have quite
                a collection. Photos are tagged by subject and category.</p>
            <p><a class='card-link' href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels Website</a></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5><span class="text-info">Unsplash</span></h5>
            <p>Unsplash has a decent collection of high quality photography, tagged and searchable.</p>
            <p><a class='card-link' href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash Website</a></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5><span class="text-info">Burst</span></h5>
            <p>Burst contains a smaller collection of free pictures, but what it has is generally high quality.</p>
            <p><a class='card-link' href="https://burst.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Burst Website</a></p>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5><span class="text-info">Wikimedia Commons</span></h5>
            <p>Free imagery that is used on Wikipedia.  The site takes contributions like Wikipedia, so there's a lot to choose from.  It's probably the best site for technical imagery.</p>
            <p><a class='card-link' href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons Website</a></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br /><p>Differrent sites have different content, so you may need to search multiple sites before you find what you're looking for.</p>
