    <h4>What is a CSS Framework?</h4><br />
    <p>A CSS Framework is a collection of CSS and sometimes JavaScript tha is meant to allow for easier web design,
        rapid development, and standards compliance.</p>
    <p>Most frameworks contain a grid system to help with responsive layout. They also include tools for typography,
        imagry and iconography, forms elements, and graphical interface elements like tabs and slideshows.</p>
    <p>This site makes use of a framework called <a href='http://getbootstrap.com/' target='_blank'>Bootstrap</a>. This
        framework uses a grid
        system for responsive design. It included the graphical elements that were used in the site's navigation bar and
        breadcrumb features at the top of the page. It also included layout elements like the card element in which this
        article
        appears.</p>
    <p>This site also uses two <a href='#article.html~a6' onclick="LoadContent('#article.html~a5')">themes</a> for the
        Bootstrap framework that provide consistent coloring and
        typography across pages of the site.</p>
