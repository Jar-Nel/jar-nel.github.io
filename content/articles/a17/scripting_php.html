    <p>I have always felt PHP was a terrible language, even at the height of its popularity. Several years ago I came
        across an article by <a href="https://eev.ee/" target="_blank">Eevee</a> titled <a
            href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/" target="_blank">PHP:
            a fractal of bad design</a> that summed up everything wrong with PHP rather nicely. Everyone considering
        using PHP should read that article first and know what it is they're getting in to. Besides, who can resist an
        article with an opening like this?</p>

            PHP is an embarrassment, a blight upon my craft. It’s so broken, but so lauded by every empowered amateur
            who’s yet to learn anything else, as to be maddening. It has paltry few redeeming qualities and I would
            prefer to forget it exists at all.

    <p>Eevee goes on to share a relatable analogy, especially if you're trying to explain the situation to non-programmers.  For the more technical details, read the rest of the article.</p>

            I can’t even say what’s wrong with PHP, because— okay. Imagine you have uh, a toolbox. A set of tools. Looks
            okay, standard stuff in there.<br /><br />

            You pull out a screwdriver, and you see it’s one of those weird tri-headed things. Okay, well, that’s not
            very useful to you, but you guess it comes in handy sometimes.<br /><br />

            You pull out the hammer, but to your dismay, it has the claw part on both sides. Still serviceable though, I
            mean, you can hit nails with the middle of the head holding it sideways.<br /><br />

            You pull out the pliers, but they don’t have those serrated surfaces; it’s flat and smooth. That’s less
            useful, but it still turns bolts well enough, so whatever.<br /><br />

            And on you go. Everything in the box is kind of weird and quirky, but maybe not enough to make it completely
            worthless. And there’s no clear problem with the set as a whole; it still has all the tools.<br /><br />

            Now imagine you meet millions of carpenters using this toolbox who tell you “well hey what’s the problem
            with these tools? They’re all I’ve ever used and they work fine!” And the carpenters show you the houses
            they’ve built, where every room is a pentagon and the roof is upside-down. And you knock on the front door
            and it just collapses inwards and they all yell at you for breaking their door.<br /><br />

            That’s what’s wrong with PHP.
