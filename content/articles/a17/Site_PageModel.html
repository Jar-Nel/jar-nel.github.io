    <p>If you were paying attention to the URL field in your browser as you navigate this site you may have noticed that
        the pages are requested a little differently. For example, the URL for this article includes the text
        PageLoader.html#article.html~a17. You might be wondering what this does and why it looks like this. On this page
        I will make an attempt to explain it.</p>
    <p>The request <span class="text-info">PageLoader.html<span class="text-warning">#</span>article.html<span class="text-warning">~</span>a17</span> is broken into three pieces. The first part, PageLoader.html,
        requests the page that has all the menu navigation, CSS themes, and JavaScript content for the site. Once the
        resources for PageLoader.html have been loaded into the browser, JavaScript takes over. The next part,
        <span class="text-info">article.html<span class="text-warning">~</span>a17</span>, instructs the JavaScript that we want to load the <span class="text-info">article.html</span> content template and populate
        it with the data for article <span class="text-info">a17</span>, which is the article youâ€™re reading now. The hash symbol (<span class="text-warning">#</span>) is used to
        separate the content from the request. I chose the hash instead of a more traditional query string because it
        can be modified without causing the browser to reload the page. This way I can support deep linking directly to
        the content but prevent reused assets from reloading and redrawing as the site is navigated after the initial
        load. It also means all of those reused assets are loaded from a single location, which allows me to change
        something like the menu structure in one place and have that change appear on every page the site loads.</p>
    <p>I chose the image of the matryoshka dolls for this article as the nested nature is similar to how this site nests
        content to build a final page. The JavaScript assembles the pages like this:</p>
    <img src="content/articles/a17/pageLoadDiagram.png">
    <div class="text-muted"><i>For the article template, article meta-data and content are loaded into the template, and
            that template is loaded into the content area of the PageLoader.html file. Each piece nests within the other
            to create the final page that is displayed by the browser.</i></div>
