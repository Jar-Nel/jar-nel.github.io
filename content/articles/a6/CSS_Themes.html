    <h4>A Little About Themes</h4><br />
    <p>CSS Themes are pre-set visual styles and layout for a website.  They apply to a website much like templates and themes apply to a slide deck in PowerPoint  </p>
    <p>Many CSS Frameworks have had themes developed for them. Themes allow for a change in the look and feel of a
        website without modification of the underlying structure of the CSS framework. This site makes use of two themes
        for the <a href='https://getbootstrap.com' target='_blank'>Bootstrap</a> framework: <a
            href='https://bootswatch.com/flatly/' target='_blank'>Flatly</a> (for the light theme), and <a
            href='https://bootswatch.com/darkly/' target='_blank'>Darkly</a> (for the dark theme). You can see this
        theme change is action by <span class="btn-link" style="cursor: pointer;"
            onclick="clickTheme(`${document.getElementById('ctlSwitchTheme').title}`)">switching the theme on this
            site</span>.</p>
    <p>Many sites and frameworks offer their own themes.  Search for themes for the framework you're considering to see what is avaiable.</p>
