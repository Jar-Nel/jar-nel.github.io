            <p>Vector graphics formats store images as a series of lines and curves that are connected by points. Each
                path may contain vaules for stroke color, shape, curve, thickness and fill.</p>
            <p>The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), the organization responsible for web standards, has selected SVG
                (Scalable Vector Graphics) as the format for the web. Many web browsers have some support for rendering
                SVG but the standard has been relatively slow to be established. There is also a compact version of SVG,
                called SVGT (SVG Tiny) that is intended for phones and mobile applications.</p>
            <p>Screens and their pixels are a raster format and vector graphics have to be converted into a raster format to be displayed.</p>
