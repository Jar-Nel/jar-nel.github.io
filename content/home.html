    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Here we explore the wonderful and interesting world of web development.</p>
    <p>This site functions like a Single Page Application (SPA), but navigates like a site with unique pages. Each URL +
        Hash will directly load the requested page, but navigation within the pages will only reload the content
        area. The title, navbar, and breadcrumb components are dynamically loaded from JSON objects, and there is no
        server side scripting component to any of it!</p>
    <p>You can peruse the site in Edge, Chrome and other Blink-based browsers, Firefox and other Quantum-based browsers,
        but not with IE. I just didn't have the time to put up with it.</p>
