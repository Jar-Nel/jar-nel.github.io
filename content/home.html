    <p class="lead">Welcome to my CIT-82 development pages</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Here we explore the wonderful and interesting world of web development.</p>
    <p>During the course of this course I learned about HTML, CSS, Frameworks like Bootstrap, and themes. These pages
        were made to showcase the material and demonstrate how I can apply what I have learned.</p>
    <p>The functionality of this site is patterend after a progressive web app (PWA) and somewhat mimics the app shell
        architecture. It can't be installed as a PWA and doesn't make use of service workers, but the major assets and
        menu system only load once on the first visit with only the dynamic content changing as the site is navigated.
        Deep linking is supported as each URL + Hash will directly load the requested page. The title, navbar, and
        breadcrumb components are dynamically loaded from JSON objects, and there is no server side scripting component
        to any of it!  All the page composition on this site takes place on the client.</p>
    <p>You can peruse the site in Edge, Chrome and other Blink-based browsers, Firefox and other Quantum-based browsers,
        but not with IE. I just didn't have the time to put up with it.</p>
    <p>There are light and dark themes available for the site. So leave the lights on, or turn them off, and see what's inside.</p>
