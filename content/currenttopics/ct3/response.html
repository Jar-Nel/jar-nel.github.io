<p>There seems to be a perception that Google is somehow better for Open Source software than Microsoft.&nbsp; In the
    current environment, that couldn't be further from the truth, and I don't know why the perception continues to
    exist.</p>
<p>Google certainly uses Open Source software, but <em>uses </em>is the key word.&nbsp; Google has become very good at
    exploiting the work of the OSS community and making billions on the back of free volunteer labor, wrapping up that
    open software in layers of proprietary code designed to lock people and businesses into Google's system despite the
    open nature of the foundations that code was originally built upon.</p><br />
<p>Ars Technica had a great write up of how Google does this with Android as an example:</p>

        iron grip on Android: Controlling open source by any means necessary.</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, under the leadership of Satya Nadella , Microsoft has become a leading <em>contributor</em> to open
    source, utilizing their own resources to bolster and support community projects and balancing their give and take
    with the OSS community.</p>
<p>GitHub is a good fit for Microsoft for a number of reasons.&nbsp; They have several company products, including the
    renowned <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, available for open source collaboration and development on GitHub;&nbsp; Hundreds of
    Microsoft employees are using GitHub for thousands of personal projects; and Microsoft recently completed
    transitioning the Windows development code base over to git for their internal development, making several important
    and welcome contributions to git in the process.</p>

    <p class="mb-0">"<i>Publishing source code is not the same as developing in the open; there are corporate
        open-source projects where all development is done privately, in-house, with few-to-no outside contributions
        accepted. The code is published periodically (often without the full commit history, so providing no way to see
        how the code was incrementally developed) with an open-source license attached. For the most part, Microsoft
        hasn't used this model; instead, it uses the GitHub for authoritative repositories, with all development
        published to GitHub as it's done. Microsoft welcomes outside contributions, uses GitHub's issue tracking to
        publicly record bugs and feature requests, and the projects engage with their user and developer communities to
        prioritize new development. <strong>This is a corporation doing open source the right way.</strong></i>"</p>

<p>Microsoft also added virtual file systems and FUSE support to Windows 10 to help facilitate Windows
    development.&nbsp; As part of that process they developed a git based virtual file system to handle git requests for
    the very large windows code base and to track the large number of daily builds.&nbsp; Microsoft added this to git as
    part of the git open source. They started this work at the beginning of 2017.</p>

        hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository</a> <br /><em>Virtualized file system approach
        makes Git work better for huge repositories.</em></p>
<p>Microsoft's early embracing of git for development, their multitude of open source projects, and their decision to
    adapt and use git for Windows development makes their purchase of GitHub a good fit for the company.</p>
<p>Microsoft's continued support of open source is a benefit to us all.&nbsp; In fact, in January 2019 GitHub removed
    their limits on private repositories at Microsoft's direction.&nbsp;</p>
