<p>I am attending FCC to get my associates degree and to transfer to CSUF for degree completion in the near future. I
    have dabbled in some line of business web applications in a WISC stack. I am interested in learning more about web
    design and creating responsive pages. With LOB applications you generally have the benefit of knowing the target
    client environment which can make one lazy when it comes to fallback code and resolution targets. :)<br /><br /> I
    am running Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit Version 1809 (Build 17763.288)</p>
