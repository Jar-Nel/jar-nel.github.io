<p>Semantic versioning is useful in the way it conveys messages to developers and users of a software package or API by
    having pre-defined meanings behind the version numbers and the number positions.&nbsp; I have some software I need
    to interact with that does <strong>not</strong> use semantic versioning and I have to go through a whole battery of
    tests and compatibility checks each time it is updated.&nbsp; If they used semantic versioning I would know when I
    can get by with fewer tests (minor versions shouldn't break backward compatibility), and when I need to do more
    (major versions break compatibility).&nbsp; If they signaled in their versioning (or at all) when an update is
    potentially backward compatibility breaking it would influence how I approach my own testing and certification of
    the software.</p>
<p>I found an interesting FAQ on semantic versioning <a href="https://semver.org/">here </a>. </p>
<p>Bootstrap
    appears to use semantic versioning.&nbsp; They are currently on version 4.2.1.&nbsp; It's the 4th major release
    of Bootstrap, it is not fully backward compatible with the 3rd release, there have been two feature updates, and
    one patch since the last feature update.</p>
